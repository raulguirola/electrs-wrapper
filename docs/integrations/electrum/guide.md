# Electrum Integration Setup

Note: You will need to be running Tor on your device, find guides to set this up here: https://start9.com/latest/user-manual/connecting/connecting-tor/tor-os/index

Caution: This will add your Electrum server, but if you want to ONLY connect to your server, you will need to run Electrum in [Single Server Mode](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tor.html) from the CLI.

1. Open Electrum and go to "Tools -> Network," or if you are running for the first time, choose "Select server manually," and click "Next."

1. That's it! You will be prompted to create a wallet if this is your first time. You can check your connection by clicking the orb in the bottom right, which should be blue in color. If your server settings persist, you are connected.
